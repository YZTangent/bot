#Telegram Bot interface for Ka.Y.E

## Deliverable

- [ ] A command for users to have the bot send them a list of events they have RSVPâ€™d to for purposes of keeping track. The list of events will include details on the event, such as the starting time as well as location if any.
- [ ] Sign in via Telegram WebApp.
- [X] Inline bot capabilities such that the user can send invitations to events without having to add other users to the server.
- [X] The ability for the bot to share events across multiple servers.
- [ ] The ability to bind words as triggers for a response, either text or an image, from the bot
- [ ] Send messages to remind users of events at certain time intervals before the start of the event eg 1 day, 1 hour.
- [ ] Allow users to register their birthdays and have the discord bot automatically send birthday announcements and/or create birthday events. 
- [ ] Command which suggests activities/places to users based on keywords, such as outdoors, sporty, online, etc. (Tentative)
- [ ] Embedded link which allows users to demarcate available timings with a pop up window of a calendar. (Tentative)

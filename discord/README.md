## Thought Process

### Potential Problems
- How do you register a command locally instead of globally?

### Command Registration Logic


### Command Invocation Logic
- Guild
  - Role
    - Command
  - Role check fail path
- Guild check fail path

### Proposed table structure


| GuildID  | Command     | Role        | Instructions      |
|---       | ----------- | ----------- |  ---              |
| GuildID1 | Command 1   | RoleID 1    | Instructions 1    |
| GuildID1 | Command 2   | RoleID 2    | Instructions 2    |

# Milestone 3
- [ ] A command for users to have the bot send them a list of events they have RSVPâ€™d to for purposes of keeping track. The list of events will include details on the event, such as the starting time as well as location if any.
- [ ] Inline bot capabilities such that the user can send invitations to events without having to add other users to the server. 
- [ ] The ability for the bot to share events across multiple servers. 
- [ ] The ability to bind words as triggers for a response, either text or an image, from the bot
  - /bind word url
  - inserts a row onto database table with guild_id, word, and url
  - bot loads dictionatry of guild_id to dictionary of words to lists of urls on startup/update
  - 
- [ ] Send messages to remind users of events at certain time intervals before the start of the event eg 1 day, 1 hour.
  - Check event table every day and pull events that match the guild
  - Send message to server if event is 1 day later
  - Create a task to send another message 23 hours later
- [ ] Allow users to register their birthdays and have the discord bot automatically send birthday announcements and/or create birthday events.
  - Execute on a per group basis
  - Lookup table every day???? (naive)
    - Look up on startup and on update commands

- [ ] Command which suggests activities/places to users based on keywords, such as outdoors, sporty, online, etc. (Tentative)
- [ ] Embedded link which allows users to demarcate available timings with a pop up window of a calendar. (Tentative)
- [ ] Administrator role checks for administrator commands
  - message.author.guild_permissions.administrator
  - 

## Bot Startup Routine
- [ ] Pull Birthdays



## Issues
- [ ] How do you send a message everyday
  - schedule module?
  - Ideas
    - Created Job
    - Store jobs, identified by group_id in a table
    - Each task has a name and id
    - unique identifier by group and name
  - 
- /remindme timeFromNow/freq what
  - birthdays and event remidners will be a subset of this


## Derivative ideas
- Daily/Weekly reminder
  - Option to ask for accoutn takeover
